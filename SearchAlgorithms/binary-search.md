# Binary Search

Think binary search as a guessing game we were playing when we were kids. For example, I want you to guess a number from 1 to 100 and when you guess I will say to you it is **greater** or **smaller** than your guess. Most important think about binary search if you want to use it you need a sorted array. If your array is not sorted it will not work.

**Big O Notation: O(log N)**

### Binary Search vs Linear Search

With an array of one hundred values here are the maximum numbers of steps it would take for each type of search.

- Linear Search: One hundred steps
- Binary Search: Seven steps

With an array of 10.000 elements, a linear search can take to 10.000 steps while a binary search takes up to **a maximum of thirteen steps**.

Keep in mind: Ordered arrays arenâ€™t faster in every aspect. Insertion in the ordered array is slower than in standard arrays.

**Trade-off**: Slower Insertion - Faster Search.

You must analyze your app to see what is better fit for you.
